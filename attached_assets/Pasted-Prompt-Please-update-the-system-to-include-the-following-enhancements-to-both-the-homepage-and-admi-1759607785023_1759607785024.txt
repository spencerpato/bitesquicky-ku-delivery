Prompt:
Please update the system to include the following enhancements to both the homepage and admin dashboard for BitesQuicky:

🏠 HOMEPAGE UPDATES

Menu Appearance:

Make the menu section smaller and more compact on mobile so it looks neat and fits more items on one screen.

Reduce card (image, title, price, and button) sizes proportionally for mobile devices.

Maintain clear spacing and padding for a clean, professional appearance.

Category Order:

Ensure Foods appear above Snacks at all times, even after refreshing or reloading.

Responsiveness:

Display 2 columns for mobile, 3 for tablets, and 4 for desktop.

Ensure text and buttons scale smoothly without overlapping.

🧾 ADMIN DASHBOARD UPDATES

Mobile Responsiveness:

Make the dashboard fully mobile-friendly and professional-looking.

Tables should scroll horizontally on mobile to prevent overflow.

Adjust font sizes, margins, and padding to make everything readable and clean on small screens.

Profit Calculation Feature:

Add a Profit Summary Card that automatically calculates the total profit from all Delivered orders.

Formula: Profit = Sum of all delivery fees for orders with status “Delivered.”

Profit updates automatically when an order’s status changes to “Delivered.”

Daily Profit Tracking:

Add a mechanism to save the day’s total profit at the end of each day (or when the admin clears all orders).

When orders are cleared, the total profit for that day should be stored in a separate table or section called “Daily Profits.”

Each entry in “Daily Profits” should show:

Date (auto-generated)

Total Profit earned that day

The next day, profit counting starts again from zero.

Clear All Orders Functionality:

Add a single “Clear All Orders” button on the admin dashboard.

When clicked, it should:

Automatically save the current day’s profit to Daily Profits.

Delete all orders from the order list.

Reset the profit counter to zero.

Include a confirmation popup before deleting (e.g., “Are you sure you want to clear all today’s orders?”).

Analytics Enhancements:

Display small summary cards showing:

Total Orders Today

Delivered Orders

Pending Orders

Daily Profit (Live total)

Underneath, display a table of Daily Profits (date + total).

UI and Style Updates:

Align all buttons (View, Download, Delete) neatly in each row.

Add soft shadows, consistent border radii, and section headers for readability.

Keep the overall look clean, modern, and consistent with the homepage design.

Note: Ensure all current features — notifications, order fetching, receipt download, and status updates — continue working correctly after these updates.
